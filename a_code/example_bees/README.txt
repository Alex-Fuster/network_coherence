Hi! We're very happy with your interest in reproducing our analysis. The code in this folder apply the concept of Ecological Network Coherence to an empirical dataset of plants and pollinators from the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil.

To reproduce our analysis, you will need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer. You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website: https://cran.r-project.org/. You can download RStudio from the RStudio website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.

To reproduce our analysis, you can run all the codes in their respective order. The codes are numbered in the order they should be run. You can change the parameters and variable names to apply the analysis to your own dataset.

The script number 06 sources all other scripts and runs the analysis, except the script number 02. That's because script number 02 is the one that gets the GBIF data, which is very time consuming and should not be run more than once. Therefore, if you've run the script number 02 once and wants to revisit the analysis, you can run the script number 06 only.

Again, if that's the first time you are running the analysis, you should run all scripts in their respective order.

The scripts that reproduce the figures are on the 99 series and source script 06. Notice that you need to have the GBIF data already downloaded in order to reproduce the figures.
